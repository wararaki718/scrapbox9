            Project Gutenberg hosts a full plain-text copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.
            URL: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/64317/64317-0.txt

            Answer as much as you can:

            1) How many lines in the complete Gutenberg file contain the substring `Gatsby` (count lines, not occurrences within a line, each line ends with a line break).
            2) The 1-based line number of the first line in the file that contains `Daisy`.
            3) A two-sentence neutral synopsis.

            Do your best on (1) and (2). If at any point you realize you cannot **verify** an exact answer with
            your available tools and reasoning, do not fabricate numbers: use `null` for that field and spell out
            the limitation in `how_you_computed_counts`. If you encounter any errors please report what the error was and what the error message was.
